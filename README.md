# Tape matrix multiplication using MPI and OpenMP
This project contains two implementations of the tape algorithm for matrix multiplication, using OpenMP and MPI for parallel computing.

## Compilation
```
make
```
OpenMP only
```
make omp
```
MPI only
```
make mpi
```

## Usage
OpenMP
```
./bin/tape_matrix_mul_omp
```
MPI
```
./bin/tape_matrix_mul_mpi
```
